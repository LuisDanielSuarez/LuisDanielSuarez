# Hi, I'm Luis

I'm a Neuroscientist moving into the alluring field of Data Science.

I've been working in Academia researching how we form and consolidate our memories.
Or in other words, how our experiences make us be who we are.

In this portfolio I plan to show some of my work as a data scientist.
Since I haven't started in the industry, just expect some excersices I do to challenge myself.

If you want to see some of my non-DS coding experiments, you can visit [my personal GitHub](https://github.com/Ignatius-Reilly) or take a look at my activity in [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/15032126/ignatius-reilly).
